## Insights from the LLM
**Advanced Statistical Analyses for Numeric Data:**
1. **Regression Analysis:** Utilize multiple linear regression to explore relationships between overall scores and quality, repeatability, and other potential predictors.
2. **ANOVA:** Conduct ANOVA to test if there are significant differences in overall ratings across different categories, such as language and type.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality, revealing key patterns and clusters in the numeric data while preserving variance.

**Clustering Techniques for Categorical Data:**
1. **K-Means Clustering:** Use K-means to group movies based on language, type, and title, identifying patterns in audience preferences.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Employ hierarchical clustering to explore relationships among creators ('by') and their impact on quality ratings.
3. **Latent Class Analysis:** Consider latent class analysis to uncover hidden groupings in viewer preferences and media types.

**Insights and Suggested Analyses:**
1. Investigate correlations between overall ratings and factors like quality and repeatability.
2. Analyze trends in ratings over time based on the date.
3. Examine clusters of viewers' preferences based on language and type to tailor content recommendations.

- Analysis '1. **Segmentation Analysis**: Perform a segmentation analysis to identify any underlying groups of respondents that may have differing perspectives on quality and repeatability. This can highlight specific demographic or behavioral characteristics influencing ratings.' could not be executed or is not supported.
- Analysis '2. **Regression Analysis**: Conduct a multiple regression analysis where overall ratings serve as the dependent variable, with quality and repeatability as independent variables. This can quantify the impact of each predictor on overall ratings.' could not be executed or is not supported.
- Analysis '3. **Factor Analysis**: Implement factor analysis to explore if quality and repeatability, alongside overall ratings, form distinct underlying constructs. This could reveal whether repeatability should be evaluated separately or integrated into overall quality.' could not be executed or is not supported.
- Analysis '4. **ANOVA**: Conduct an ANOVA to assess if there are significant differences in ratings across different segments of respondents (e.g., based on demographic factors).' could not be executed or is not supported.
- Analysis '5. **Data Normalization or Transformation**: Consider normalizing or applying logarithmic transformations to the variables to mitigate skewness in distributions, especially if considering advanced statistical techniques. ' could not be executed or is not supported.

## Function API suggested by LLM for further analysis and insights
For advanced statistical analyses on the numeric columns ('overall', 'quality', 'repeatability'), consider employing a regression analysis to investigate the predictive relationships between these variables. Additionally, conducting a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can help reduce dimensionality and identify underlying patterns in the data. You can also explore outlier detection methods (e.g., Z-score or IQR) to assess the impact of extreme values on the dataset.

For the categorical columns ('date', 'language', 'type', 'title', 'by'), consider using clustering algorithms like K-Means or hierarchical clustering to group similar instances based on categorical attributes. Employing Association Rule Mining (e.g., Apriori algorithm) can reveal interesting associations between different categories, such as frequent co-occurrences of languages and types.

Top 3 specific Python function calls for extracting insights:
1. `df.corr()` to compute the correlation matrix between numeric variables.
2. `PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(X)` from sklearn for dimensionality reduction. 
3. `sns.clustermap()` from seaborn to visualize patterns in categorical data.

## Visualizations and Insights from the distribution plo
![media\distribution_overall.png](media\distribution_overall.png)
Distribution_quality.png insights:
1. Peaks indicate quality ratings predominantly at 3 and 4.
2. Distribution is multimodal with several frequency spikes.
3. Few ratings below 2, indicating low quality is rare.
![media\distribution_quality.png](media\distribution_quality.png)
Distribution_overall.png insights:
1. Highest frequency at overall rating of 3.0 observed.  
2. Distribution shows peaks around 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0.  
3. Skewed distribution indicates preference for moderate ratings overall.  
![media\distribution_repeatability.png](media\distribution_repeatability.png)
Distribution_repeatability.png insights:
1. Distribution shows peaks at repeatability values of 1.0 and 2.0.  
2. Higher frequency near values 1.0 indicates consistent results.  
3. Lower frequency at 2.5 and above suggests less reliability.
